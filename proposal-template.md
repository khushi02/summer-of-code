## Project

_Write examples for official libraries._

## Abstract

_Short description of your project. Max 10 sentences. This **SHOULD NOT** be a
copy of the project idea text._

## Technical Details

_Long description of the project. **Must** include all technical details of the
projects, like libraries involved._

_Here you can show relevant pieces of code that you want to change. You can
link to literature you used during the research._

## Schedule of Deliverables

_Here should come a list of your milestones. This list is a start based on the
difference phases of GSoC. Use it as a start. You can/should add more details
for each phase by breaking it down into weeks or set specific targets for each
phase. Each target should be split into sub task with a time estimate, [work
breakdown structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) are helpful here._

### **Community Bonding Period**

_What will you do during the community bonding period?_

### **Phase 1 (June 1 - June 29)**

* Deliverable 1
  * Week 1 - Draft and finalize 3-5 examples for the *servo* library. This includes hardware images and fritzing schematics.
    * Ideas:
      * Implement examples with ultrasonic sensors and photresisters
      * Demonstrate uses of common objects such as buttons, switches, joysticks, and potentiometers (already included)
  * Week 2 - Draft and finalize 3-5 examples (may change based on time analysis from previous week) for the *capacitive sensor* library. This includes hardwar images and fritzing schematics
    * Ideas:
      * Simple dispenser system
      * Touch sensing grid
      * Mini keyboard
* Deliverable 2
  * Week 3 - Draft and finalize 2-3 examples (these projects take longer) for the *keyboard* library. This includes hardware images and fritzing schematics. 
    * Ideas:
      * Mini musical keyboard
      * 4x3 (or another dimension) keypad
  * Week 4 - Draft and finalize 2-3 examples for the *mouse* library. This includes hardware images and fritzing schematics. Use extra time to clean up old code, double-check fritzing and hardware images, and ensure all deliverables have been met so far.
    * Ideas:
      * Integrate the Arduino and a USB mouse
      * Create a touchpad tracker

### **Phase 2 (July 3 - July 27)**

* Deliverable 1
* Deliverable 2
* ...

### **Phase 2 (July 31 - August 24)**

* Deliverable 1
* Deliverable 2
* ...

### **Final Week (August 24 - August 31)**

_At this stage you should finish up your project. At this stage you should make
sure that you have code submitted to your organization. Our criteria to mark
your project as a success is to submit code before the end of GSoC._

## Development Experience

_Do you have code on GitHub? Can you show previous contributions to other projects?
Did you do other code related projects or university courses?_

_Do you have experience with Arduino?_
