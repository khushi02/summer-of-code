## Project

Write examples for official libraries.

## Abstract

This project is designed to create a comprehensive set of examples for the official Arduino libraries. Projects will range from beginner-friendy to advanced, with code and diagrams that are easy to replicate. These examples will integrate various different libraries and leverage external components in order to facilitate an in-depth understanding of the library's functions and the Arduino as a whole.

## Technical Details

_Long description of the project. **Must** include all technical details of the
projects, like libraries involved._

_Here you can show relevant pieces of code that you want to change. You can
link to literature you used during the research._

## Schedule of Deliverables

### **Community Bonding Period**

* Familiarize myself with my mentors and the other GSoC participants 
* Discuss my ideas with the team/mentors
* Adjust my ideas with the feedback that I receive 
* Finalize the projects and obtain approval

### **Phase 1 (June 1 - June 29)**

* Deliverable 1
  * Week 1 - Draft 3-5 examples for the **servo** library. This includes hardware images and fritzing schematics.
    * Ideas:
      * Implement examples with ultrasonic sensors and photresisters
      * Demonstrate uses of common objects such as buttons, switches, joysticks, and potentiometers (already included)
  * Week 2 - Implement suggestions from mentors and ensure that code is clean. Finalize examples.
* Deliverable 2
  * Week 3 - Draft 3-5 examples (may change based on time analysis from previous week) for the **capacitive sensor** library. This includes hardware images and fritzing schematics
    * Ideas:
      * Simple dispenser system
      * Touch sensing grid
      * Mini keyboard
  * Week 4 - Implement suggestions from mentors and ensure that code is clean. Finalize examples.

### **Phase 2 (July 3 - July 27)**

* Deliverable 1
  * Week 5 - Draft 2-3 examples (these projects take longer) for the **keyboard** library. This includes hardware images and fritzing schematics. 
    * Ideas:
      * Mini musical keyboard
      * 4x3 (or another dimension) keypad
   * Week 6 - Implement suggestions from mentors and ensure that code is clean. Finalize examples.
* Deliverable 2
  * Week 7 - Draft 2-3 examples for the **mouse** library. This includes hardware images and fritzing schematics. Use extra time to clean up old code, double-check fritzing and hardware images, and ensure all deliverables have been met so far.
    * Ideas:
      * Integrate the Arduino and a USB mouse
      * Create a touchpad tracker
  * Week 8 - Implement suggestions from mentors and ensure that code is clean. Finalize examples.

### **Phase 2 (July 31 - August 24)**

* Deliverable 1
* Deliverable 2
* ...

### **Final Week (August 24 - August 31)**

* Go back and review all code for hidden errors, redundancies, and unprofessional coding practices
* Make sure all code is clean and easy to read with plentiful comments
* Check that diagrams and documentation are provided where necessary
